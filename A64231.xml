            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER</head>
            <p>WHen we ſeriouſly Conſider the grand Injury the Church of Chriſt ſuffers from the Diſſenſions amongſt us on one hand, and the Impieties acted by us on the other; how both muſt needs hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Converſion of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> while they know not with whom to cloſe, every one crying up Chriſt in their own Party and few or none practiſing ſuitably to their Principles, ſo that a Jew or Heathen can ſcarce think we truly believe our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſtianity, whoſe Practices are ſo contrary to it, that a ſober Heathen would
<pb facs="tcp:38083:5"/>bluſh to ſee, and be aſhamed to do thoſe things, as the Learned <hi>Hammond</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Pract. Cat. pag. 117.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It highly concerns every one to prevent theſe Enormities for the future, and to endeavour to ſtop them for the preſent, being aſſured none can be good Subjects who are bad Chriſtians, nor can they be Loyal to the King who are Rebels againſt God. A Vicious Man, according to the Heathens Obſervations, can be no good Citizen. <hi>Val. Max. Lib. 2. c. 6. Num. 6.</hi> but oft pulls Vengeance on it. <hi>Heſiod. opera lib. 1. v. 236, to 242.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To prevent then the Miſchiefs of Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, which our Diviſions and Profaneſs tend to, the great Duty of Catechizing muſt certainly be neceſſary and expedient, whereby Perſons being Inſtructed in the true Principles of Chriſtianity, will not be when Men in Years ſo much Children as to be toſſed to and fro with every Wind of Doctrine. And being Educated in the Duties of Religion, will not willingly be Debauched and make Ship-wrack of Faith and a good Conſcience. The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and Neceſſity of Catechiſing are ſo
<pb facs="tcp:38083:5"/>great, that moſt Diſſenters Practice it, and our great defect is its neglect, to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur which, I humbly propoſe a plain, yet full Expoſition of the Catechiſm of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Vindicated from all Objections I have met with, and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally diſpoſed of into Queſtion and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, ſo as may moſt Edifie the Learner, who need not trouble his mind with what Sentences are marked. And leſt the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the words af any Author might render it burdenſom to the Memory, I have Tranſcribed the ſubſtance of what they ſay, placing the Author in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, that they who pleaſe may conſult at large what I conciſely write.</p>
            <p>And as for the Heathens Citations I chiefly aim at, <note place="margin">Sueton. in Aug. c. 89.</note> what <hi>Suetonius</hi> Records to have been the Practice of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> who obſerved in all he did read, what was of Duties, and imparted them to others whom he converſed with; ſo my Deſign is thereby to manifeſt that Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity the Heathen Practiſed, to ſhame our Impieties, and to oblige us as Men and Chriſtians, to Live anſwerably to our

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He is the only Lord of all the World, to whom we and all his creatures do owe obedience by ſeveral Rights by which God may claim it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By our Creation. He made us and not we ourſelves: he formed our bodies of the Duſt,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 95.6, 7.</note> and infuſed our ſouls, ſo that every faculty of our ſouls, and part of our bodies are ſeveral obligations to worſhip God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our preſervation. God as the great Houſholder of the World, provides for all his Creatures; <note place="margin">Acts 17. — 28.</note> and in him we live, move and have our being, and as we daily live of his mercy, ought to live to his glory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The price of our Redemption. We are to God a purchaſed poſſeſſion. He gave his Son to die, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.19, 20.</note> that he might by his Sons ſufferings grant us life, and purchaſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:38083:17"/>us to ſerve him. <hi>Now what we buy and pay for, we may expect to be ſerved with; much more then may God expect to be ſerved by us!</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. All Creatures pay him obedience. Sun, Moon, Stats keep their ſtate God firſt placed them in. The Sea exceeds not its bounds, the Earth remains habitable, and Air convenient for us to breathe in, unleſs the God of Nature pleaſe to alter their courſe to puniſh ſin, and then a flood ſhall drown the World, <note place="margin">Gen. 6. — 19. Num. 16.</note> and fire deſcend from Heaven, the Earth ſhall open, and the Air by infection deſtroy.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How ſhould God's Soveraignty affect us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It ſhould make us conſider, 1. That we are not our own but Gods. 2. That being his, it is but reaſonable we ſhould ſerve him. 3. It ſhould ſhame us for our rebellious ſins, ſince all our fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures obey his pleaſure. 4.

               <hi>A.</hi> His Attribute of Almighty declares his power. His Title of Father denotes his goodneſs; the one evidenceth him able, the other willing to do us good.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How is God a Father to us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. By Creation. He made us and not we our ſelves.</p>

            <p n="3">3. God is our Father thro Chriſt by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <note place="margin">Joh. 1.12</note> God as our Father hath provided an inheritance for us as Sons, whom he is pleaſed to account as co-heirs with Chriſt.</p>

            <p>Q. <hi>What is the Fourth Commandment?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. <hi>Remember that thou keep Holy the Sabbath Day, Sir days ſhalt thou labour and do all that thou haſt to do, but the Seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: In it thou ſhalt do no manner of Work, Thou, and thy Son, and thy Daughter, Thy Man-ſervant, and thy Maid-ſervant, Thy Cattel, and the Stranger that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thy Gates. For in Sir days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Sea,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:38083:40"/>and all that in them is, and reſted the Seventh day, wherefore the Lord Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Seventh day and Hallowed it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What is the deſign of this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. A ſetting apart a time for the more Publick Worſhip of God, though our whole Life ſhould be a Serving him, yet ſome time is requiſite to be obſerved for an unanimous Solemn Publick Serving him.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Wherein is the Morality of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. 1. In obſerving a ſet time Solemnly ſet apart for Gods Publick Worſhip. 2. In ordering that this be a ſeventh part of our time.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Why was the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Sabbath changed into our Chriſtian Lords Day, or their Seventh altered, and our firſt day of the Week ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. 1. Its Inſtitution or Sanction was not only in reſpect of the Creation,
<note place="margin">Gen. 2. Deut. 5.15.</note> but of the Deliverance of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Now, our Deliverance by Chriſt was Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified by their Deliverance from <hi>Egypt,</hi> and was far greater than theirs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might reaſonably have a day ſet apart in Remembrance of it. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>B.</hi> Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>on Creed,</hi> 264, 265.</note> And the Sanction of the Sabbath in Remembrance of that Deliverance might equally Typifie the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:38083:40"/>Obſervation of our Sabbath on the day of our Deliverance, <note place="margin">B. Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors <hi>holy Living,</hi> p. 290. Exo. 12.1.</note> ſince its Obſervance was not ſtrictly confined to the remembrance of the Creation. 2. The change of the Seventh day to the Firſt ſeems to be Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the changing of the Seventh Month before the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> into the Firſt Month after it,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 110.3.</note> by Gods own appointment. 3. Its change is Propheſied of in that <hi>Pſalm</hi> which relates to Chriſts Prophetick Office, where his People are ſaid to be a willing People in the day of his Power, in the beauty of Holineſs. Or as it is in our Divine Service, <note place="margin">Pſal. 118.22.</note> The People ſhall Offer thee Free-will Offerings with an Holy Worſhip, in the day of thy Power. Now, the day of Chriſts Power was that day of his Reſurrection, <note place="margin">Mat. 28.1. Pſal. 118.24.</note> wherein he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted his Conqueſt over Death, Hell, and the Grave, and that was on the Firſt Day of the Week. And we will rejoyce and be glad in it. 4. Chriſt was Lord of the Sabbath Day, and might alter it; and by his Preſence twice amongſt his Diſciples met together and Celebrating the Duties of that day, Bleſſing them, <note place="margin">John 20.19, 26.</note> and pronouncing Peace to them, warranted their Practice, and Evidenced its Divine Authority. 5. The Practice of the Church in the Apoſtles time, <hi>John</hi> 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1. and ever ſince.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. All want of due Preparation for the Obſervance of our Sabbath. 2.

            <p>Q. <hi>What is here Commanded?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. To reſt from all unneceſſary works of our Calling. 2. To Dedicate that Reſt to God, and to ſpend every day as a reſt from ſin. 3.

            <pb n="72" facs="tcp:38083:42"/>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. It is introduced more Solemnly than the reſt with a <hi>Remember.</hi> 2. It is placed between both Tables, as if both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on its Obſervance, or if as the laſt of the firſt Table, its Obſervance per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects our Duty towards God. 3. It is highly reaſonable. God might have Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Six days for his own Service, and have left us but one day for our Employs, but he requires but one, and leaveth us ſix. 4. We have no reaſon to expect a Bleſſing on our days of Labour, if we neglect our Duties to God in his day of Worſhip. 5. It is delivered both Negatively and Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, that we might no ways avoid its Obligation. <note place="margin">Gen. 2. John 20. Ezek. 20</note> 6. God himſelf, Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the Men of God in all Ages have been exemplary in its Obſervance. 7.

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes. 1. Chriſt gives a Plea for it in the Lords Prayer. 2. Unity of Petitions in a Congregation pleads for it. 3. If every one was left to his particular Addreſſes it would tend to Confuſion in a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 4. It is a great help to weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who hereby are inſtructed what to Pray. 5. It may be better accompanied with Zeal than other Prayers, becauſe its Petitions are known by the Praying Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and may be ſuited with Affection. 6. Men are more confined to the conceived Prayer, or extempore Prayer of any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon than to a Form of Prayer, becauſe in a Form they know what will be Prayed for, and what Petitions will be uſed, and ſo know how to ſuit them, and what to ſay Amen to, when as in a conceived or extempore Prayer, the hearer knows not what to ſay Amen to, till the Petition be expreſſed, which probably may then be ſo erroneous or Blaſphemous, as it ought not to be joyned with.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1.

               <hi>A.</hi> 1. Becauſe we cannot ask more than God can give us, <hi>Natural Parents may be willing, but cannot often help their Children. But our Father both will and can.</hi>
               <note place="margin">James 4.3. Prov. 1.16.</note> 2. To teach us if we have not what we deſire, it is not for want of Power in God, but either, 1. Becauſe we ſinned in asking what was ſinful. Or, 2. What was not convenient. Or, 3. We deſired it for bad ends. Or, 4. To try our Affections in Prayer. Or, 5. To re-mind us of our

            <p>Q. <hi>How is the Sacrament a Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſts Death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. The Bread and Wine ſet apart for the Uſe of the Sacrament denotes Chriſts ſeparation for the Work of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Breads breaking, Chriſts Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying; its eating, our receiving Chriſt, and our Union with him. 2. The Wine ſhews Chriſts Blood diſtinct from his Body, as ſhed for us. The pouring out the Wine ſhews the ſhedding his Blood, and our drinking it, our applying Chriſts Blood to cleanſe us from ſin.</p>

            <p>Q. <hi>Why is it not yet counted a Sacrifice?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. Chriſt is not again Offered. 2. Chriſt is not ours, nor in our power to Offer. 3. <note place="margin">Heb. 9.25, 26.</note> His Offering himſelf once for all is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.</p>
